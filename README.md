## 🚀 About Me

I’m a backend-focused software engineer and AI enthusiast, passionate about building useful tools with strong architecture and a touch of creativity.

I recently built [**Selfai**](https://www.selfai.tech) — a document-trained AI widget that helps people showcase their story through a personalized, embeddable chatbot. It’s live, running on my portfolio, and being used today.

I'm especially interested in backend systems, AI/LLM infrastructure, developer tools, and products that empower others to express themselves through code.

## ❤️ Fun Facts

- I built SelfAI out of a desire to help people like myself break the ice while networking and reaching out.
- I’m obsessed with design flow — I’ll rework it a dozen times if it doesn’t *feel right*.
- I love tackling problems, debugging, clean architecture, and meaningful conversations (even if with AI!)
